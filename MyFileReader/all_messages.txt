Although this transition will not have any impact on your Cablevision service, analog sets not connected to Cablevision's service may need additional equipment (i.e., converter box) or may have to be replaced. Analog-only TVs should continue to work as before to receive low power, Class A or translator television stations and with cable and satellite TV services, gaming consoles, VCRs, DVD players, and similar products.`,45,0><NL><NL><ST,`Information about the DTV transition is available from`,45,0><SUL><ST,` `,45,37><EUL><SUL><ST,`www.DTV.gov `,45,0><EUL><ST,`or Cablevision at 1-866-670-0856 and `,45,0><SUL><ST,`www.optimum.com/transition`,45,37><EUL><CW><ST,`, and from `,45,0><SUL><ST,`www.dtv2009.gov `,45,37><EUL><ST,`or 1-888-DTV-2009 for information about subsidized coupons for digital-to-analog converter boxes`,45,0><NL>
